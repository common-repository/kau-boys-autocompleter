msgid "Kau-Boy's AutoCompleter <b>is deprecated and will be removed</b> from the plugin directory on <b>June 19, 2023</b>, 14 years after its first release. Thanks to everyone who used the plugin, gave constructive feedback, rated it and send me messages on how it helped them with their sites. This was <a href=\"https://kau-boys.de/19/allgemein/mein-erster-blog\">my very first WordPress plugin, and it started my journey into the WordPress community</a>. If you see this message, you are one of few, who still have this plugin installed. But now feel free to remove it from your site. If you still want an auto-completion/suggestion, try out <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-search-suggest/\">WP Search Suggest</a>, which is still actively maintained. You can find my other plugins <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/kau-boy/#content-plugins\">on my WordPress profile page</a>."
